# Git Workshop
This is the set of instructions, labs, and follow-along-with-the-instructor script for Matthew McCullough's Git courseware.

This course is taught via [GitHub](http://github.com/training/online), [No Fluff Just Stuff](), [JAX](http://jax.de/2011/speaker/), [SDC](http://www.scandevconf.se/2011/conference/speakers/matthew-mccullough/), [33rd Degree](http://33degree.org/talks.html), [DevNexus](http://www.devnexus.com/s/presentations;jsessionid=F59B3B58DD63C314B6E17772A56A54D4), [JFokus](http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/page.jsp?id=traininggit) and many other conferences and [private events](http://github.com/training/online).

## Other Git Links
If you want to explore Git to a maximum depth, I recommend [Scott Chacon's free Git ebook, ProGit](http://progit.org/). I also curate a series of [Git links via Delicious bookmarks](http://www.delicious.com/matthew.mccullough/git).

## Contributions
Pull requests are welcome. If you see something that needs adjusted, give back to the community and fix it. It feels great and ultimately helps others learn Git. That person you help may one day be your co-worker and you'll be glad you chipped in.
